# Secure Image Steganography with Hybrid Cryptography

**Current Status:** Phase 1 Complete (Foundation & Key Infrastructure)  
**Team:** 4 Members  
**Tech Stack:** Java 21, Maven, AtlantaFX (UI)

---

## 1. Project Overview
This tool secures sensitive text data using a "Defense in Depth" approach. It combines **Adaptive Encryption** (Caesar/Vigenère/AES) with **Image Steganography** (LSB Embedding) and protects key exchange using **Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)**.

---

## 2. Current Implementation (What works now)
We have established the "Clean Start" architecture:

* **File Input & Basic Encryption:**
    * `src/main/java/com/stego/FileEncryptor.java`
    * Reads text files, splits logic, and applies encryption based on word length.
* **ECC Key Infrastructure:**
    * `src/main/java/com/stego/ECCManager.java`
    * Generates valid `secp256r1` Key Pairs.
    * Handles Base64 Key Encoding/Decoding for the UI.

## 3. Setup Instructions (For Teammates)
**Prerequisites:**
1.  **Java 21 (LTS)** installed.
2.  **VS Code** with the "Extension Pack for Java".

**How to Run:**
1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Open the folder in VS Code.
3.  Wait for Maven to build the project.
4.  Run `src/main/java/com/stego/FileEncryptor.java` to test the logic.

## 4. Next Steps (Work Distribution)

### 👤 Member 2: Cryptography Engineer
* **Task:** Create `HybridEncryptor.java`.
* **Goal:** Implement the logic to encrypt the AES session key using the ECC Public Key generated by `ECCManager`.

### 👤 Member 3: Steganography Specialist
* **Task:** Create `ImageStego.java`.
* **Goal:** Port the LSB image hiding logic from the old project. Ensure it supports reading from the file stream.

### 👤 Member 4: Frontend Lead
* **Task:** Initialize the UI.
* **Goal:** Add **AtlantaFX** to `pom.xml`, create the Main GUI class, and build the TabPane layout (Encrypt vs. Decrypt).
